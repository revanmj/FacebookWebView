# FacebookWebView
Simple Facebook client for Android that just opens its mobile site on a full screen (with hidden Action Bar but with visible status and navigations bars). It has working file uploads for photos and geolocation for checking in to places (thanks to the Advanced WebView library from [here](https://github.com/delight-im/Android-AdvancedWebView)). It also supports Material Design elements like custom color of the status bar background.

Here are some screenshots:
